## Overview

This project took me roughly 20 minutes to complete. I did google some things to make it more efficient afterwards. ie ensuring the QR Section would be exactly center on all devices.

I also added a shadow, because I like them.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The following code is an element that I found that enabled me to enure the section was exactly centred on all devices. This is something I had not used before.

  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
